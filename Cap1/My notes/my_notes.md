# Notes
- Nmap scan differs when it is under different wifi
- From nmap -Pn scan I found out that about 23 ports are open.
- I tried to search for username and password for phpMyAdmin from mysql and 10.3.21.140/doc. (Proves are in the Search folder)
- I could't find anything from that website so I will try exploiting from the terminal.
- I will use Metaexploit because kali linux has that tool already installed. 

- I found telnet port hard to break in.
- Most important ports are open and are easy to break in
- Ports used by most of the hacker are open 
- To secure website, these ports has to be closed.
